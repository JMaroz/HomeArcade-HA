## Changelog

### v2.32.0
- **Unified Sidebar Navigation** — Wired in the full-featured `Sidebar.tsx` component for all secondary pages (Settings, History, Achievements). On desktop it renders as a collapsible icon sidebar; on mobile it automatically becomes a slide-out sheet panel.
- **Removed legacy navigation** — Replaced the old `DesktopSidebar`, `MobileBottomNav`, and `NavigationDrawer` with the single unified sidebar system.

### v2.31.0
- **Removed Friends/Social Hub page** — Eliminated the placeholder Social Hub page and all associated navigation links, as it contained only mock data with no backend support.
- **Fixed default dashboard routing** — Restored the HomeArcadeTheme as the correct default view, resolving a regression that was showing an incorrect layout with a bottom navigation bar.

### v2.30.0
- **Unified Game Details:** Consolidated all dashboard themes (`HomeArcade`, `NES`, `PXL`) to use a single, feature-rich `GameDetailDialog`, eliminating redundant UI and improving consistency.
- **Leaner Frontend:** Removed over 500 lines of legacy code and unused state logic.
- **Deep Linking:** Added support for the `?game=id` URL parameter for direct access to game details.

### v2.24.0
- **Major Feature: In-App Warp Scanner:** Integrated a native QR code scanner directly into the mobile dashboard. This allows you to scan Warp Links from your PC without leaving the Home Assistant app, completely eliminating "401 Unauthorized" login issues.
- **Improved Handoff Flow:** Scanned links instantly transition your mobile session to the active game and automatically load your handoff save state.

### v2.23.9
- **Warp Link Mobile UX:** Added a "Login Reminder" to the Warp Link panel. To prevent "401 Unauthorized" errors, ensure you are logged into Home Assistant in your phone's browser before scanning the code.
- **Improved QR Layout:** Refined the QR code display for better visibility and added a cache-buster to handoff URLs.

### v2.23.8
- **Fix: Warp Link save method:** Fixed a `TypeError` by using the proven `quickSave` method for handoff saves, ensuring compatibility with NES and other cores.
- **Improved Sync:** Increased the synchronization timeout to ensure handoff saves are fully uploaded before the QR code is displayed.

### v2.23.4
- **Maintenance:** Synchronized all project changelogs and manifests to ensure consistent update tracking for Home Assistant.

### v2.23.3
- **Fix: Warp Link Reliability:** Switched Warp Link to Slot 0 (Auto-save) for universal core compatibility. Added a robust retry loop and explicit virtual-filesystem flushing to ensure saves are fully synced before generating a warp point.
- **Improved UX:** Selection on the dashboard is now locked to clicks only, preventing accidental switching while moving the mouse.

### v2.23.2
- **Warp Link Manual Fallback:** Added a manual Warp Link fallback in case Home Assistant security policies block external QR code images.

### v2.23.1
- **Improved Dashboard UX:** Optimized game selection logic.

### v2.23.0
- **Feature: Warp Link Handoff:** Seamlessly transition gameplay from PC to mobile via QR code scanning.
- **Enhanced Dashboard UX:** Browsing now requires two presses to launch, supporting game inspection.
- **Improved Focus Management:** Full synchronization between keyboard, mouse, and gamepad focus states.

### v2.22.17
- **Fix:** Resolved a `ReferenceError: useRef is not defined` that caused the dashboard to crash.

### v2.22.16
- **Atomic Metadata Imports:** Implemented database transactions for RetroBat XML imports to prevent library corruption.

### v2.22.15
- **Console-Grade Dashboard:** Enabled full physical gamepad navigation for the main dashboard.
- **Micro-UX Touch Controls:** Optimized the on-screen touchpad for mobile devices with haptic feedback.
- **Overscan Safety:** Added CSS safe-area handling to the emulator player.

### v2.22.14
- **Feature: Save State Re-Syncing:** Save states are now permanently linked to the game file's unique hash. If you delete and re-upload the same game, the system will automatically find and re-link your previous save states.

### v2.22.13
- **Feature: Resume from Last Save:** You can now resume your games directly from the dashboard. If a save state exists, a new "Resume" button will appear in the game detail panel.
- **Visual Feedback:** Added a "Latest Save" status card to the game overview.

### v2.22.12
- **Scraper Enhancement:** Improved TheGamesDB matching logic with fuzzy title fallbacks. Descriptions and release dates are now much more likely to populate for existing games.

### v2.22.11
- **Enhanced Mobile Navigation:** Redesigned the system selector bar to include a pinned "Quick Actions" overlay. The Library and Settings icons are now consistently visible and easier to tap, featuring improved contrast and a subtle background gradient to prevent content overlap.

### v2.22.10
- **Fix:** Resolved a `ReferenceError: LayoutGrid is not defined` crashing the mobile dashboard.

### v2.22.9
- **Fix:** Resolved a bug in the BIOS upload logic where incorrect data handling caused uploads to fail with a "toLowerCase" error.

### v2.22.8
- **Mobile UX Improvement:** Added a "Library" icon next to the Settings icon for quicker navigation on mobile devices.

### v2.22.7
- **Mobile Access Fix:** Added a persistent settings icon to the system selector bar, ensuring mobile and tablet users can access the settings panel even when the desktop header is hidden.

### v2.22.6
- **Fix:** Corrected API routing issues for Home Assistant Ingress. Widespread "Not Found" errors in Settings and Game Details are now resolved by correctly resolving the relative base path.

### v2.22.5
- **Fix:** Resolved "bootstrap.js blocked" error on systems requiring a BIOS (PS1, PS2, SegaCD, GBA, etc.).

### v2.22.4
- **Layout Optimization** — Reduced redundant headers and improved vertical spacing on mobile devices for a more compact UI.

### v2.22.3
- **Visual Polish** — Hidden unwanted browser scrollbars for a cleaner "app-like" experience.

### v2.22.2
- **UI Refinement** — Removed the bottom bar and controller hints for a cleaner interface.

### v2.22.1
- **Official Rebranding** — Fully transitioned from PlayHub to **HomeArcade**.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Box art isn't showing for my games.**
You need free ScreenScraper credentials. Go to **Settings → Services** and enter your ScreenScraper username and password. Once saved, open any game's detail card and tap **Refresh Art**, or use **Scrape All ROMs** to batch-update your library.

**The emulator shows a blank screen or "Blocked by response" error.**
This is a browser security header conflict common in some Home Assistant setups. HomeArcade explicitly disables COOP/COEP headers to prevent this. If you still see it, try opening HomeArcade in a standalone browser tab instead of the HA sidebar panel.

**My ROM won't launch — I see a red error message.**
Check that the HomeArcade add-on is running in Home Assistant. If it restarted recently, wait 10–15 seconds and try again. For PS1/PS2/GBA/SegaCD games, ensure you have uploaded the correct BIOS file in **Settings → Health**.

**Warp Link QR code fails or says "Warp Failed".**
Make sure you are logged into Home Assistant in your phone's browser before scanning. The warp link contains your HA session — if you're not logged in, it will return a 401 error. Scan the code from within the HA Companion App for best results.

**I uploaded a ROM but it doesn't appear in the library.**
Try pulling down to refresh the page. If it still doesn't appear, check the add-on logs in Home Assistant for upload errors. Very large files (PS2 ISOs) may take a minute to process.

**How do I enable Kiosk Mode?**
Kiosk Mode hides the Settings, History, and Achievements navigation links — ideal for a shared TV or arcade cabinet. Enable it in **Settings → Library** by toggling the Kiosk Mode switch. To exit kiosk mode, navigate directly to `/#/settings` in the browser.

**The sidebar doesn't appear on mobile.**
On mobile, the sidebar is a slide-out panel. Tap the hamburger menu button (☰) at the top of any secondary page (Settings, History, Achievements) to open it.
