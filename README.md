## Changelog

### v2.23.1
- **Fix: Warp QR Code:** Added error handling and visual fallbacks for the Warp Link QR code generation.
- **Improved Dashboard UX:** Selection now strictly requires a click. Moving the mouse no longer changes the active game, making it much easier to select a title and move the cursor to the action buttons without accidental switching.

### v2.23.0
- **Feature: Warp Link Handoff:** Seamlessly transition gameplay from PC to mobile. Save your game on one device and scan a QR code to continue instantly on another.
- **Enhanced Dashboard UX:** Browsing now requires two presses to launch, allowing you to select a game and view its details/saves without starting the player.
- **Improved Focus Management:** Full synchronization between keyboard, mouse, and gamepad focus states on the main dashboard.

### v2.22.17
- **Fix:** Resolved a `ReferenceError: useRef is not defined` that caused the dashboard to crash.

### v2.22.16
- **Atomic Metadata Imports:** Implemented database transactions for RetroBat XML imports to prevent library corruption.

### v2.22.15
- **Console-Grade Dashboard:** Enabled full physical gamepad navigation for the main dashboard.
- **Micro-UX Touch Controls:** Optimized the on-screen touchpad for mobile devices with haptic feedback.
- **Overscan Safety:** Added CSS safe-area handling to the emulator player.

### v2.22.14
- **Feature: Save State Re-Syncing:** Save states are now permanently linked to the game file's unique hash. If you delete and re-upload the same game, the system will automatically find and re-link your previous save states.

### v2.22.13
- **Feature: Resume from Last Save:** You can now resume your games directly from the dashboard. If a save state exists, a new "Resume" button will appear in the game detail panel.
- **Visual Feedback:** Added a "Latest Save" status card to the game overview.

### v2.22.12
- **Scraper Enhancement:** Improved TheGamesDB matching logic with fuzzy title fallbacks. Descriptions and release dates are now much more likely to populate for existing games.

### v2.22.11
- **Enhanced Mobile Navigation:** Redesigned the system selector bar to include a pinned "Quick Actions" overlay. The Library and Settings icons are now consistently visible and easier to tap, featuring improved contrast and a subtle background gradient to prevent content overlap.

### v2.22.10
- **Fix:** Resolved a `ReferenceError: LayoutGrid is not defined` crashing the mobile dashboard.

### v2.22.9
- **Fix:** Resolved a bug in the BIOS upload logic where incorrect data handling caused uploads to fail with a "toLowerCase" error.

### v2.22.8
- **Mobile UX Improvement:** Added a "Library" icon next to the Settings icon for quicker navigation on mobile devices.

### v2.22.7
- **Mobile Access Fix:** Added a persistent settings icon to the system selector bar, ensuring mobile and tablet users can access the settings panel even when the desktop header is hidden.

### v2.22.6
- **Fix:** Corrected API routing issues for Home Assistant Ingress. Widespread "Not Found" errors in Settings and Game Details are now resolved by correctly resolving the relative base path.

### v2.22.5
- **Fix:** Resolved "bootstrap.js blocked" error on systems requiring a BIOS (PS1, PS2, SegaCD, GBA, etc.).

### v2.22.4
- **Layout Optimization** — Reduced redundant headers and improved vertical spacing on mobile devices for a more compact UI.

### v2.22.3
- **Visual Polish** — Hidden unwanted browser scrollbars for a cleaner "app-like" experience.

### v2.22.2
- **UI Refinement** — Removed the bottom bar and controller hints for a cleaner interface.

### v2.22.1
- **Official Rebranding** — Fully transitioned from PlayHub to **HomeArcade**.
