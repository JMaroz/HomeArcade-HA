## 1.1.3 – 2026-05-14

- **New**: **Bulk Scrape** — Added a "Scrape All" button in Settings → Services to refresh metadata and art for all unscraped or failed ROMs.
- **Fix**: **Settings UI Restored** — Fixed a regression where the Services and Kiosk tabs were missing from the Settings menu.
- **Fix**: **Build Stability** — Resolved multiple TypeScript errors and missing dependency issues to ensure a healthy production build.

## 1.1.2 – 2026-05-14

- **Fix**: Art Scraping — Resolved a ReferenceError in the Libretro fallback that caused art scraping to fail for many titles.
- **Fix**: Cheat Retrieval — Restored the missing `/api/roms/:id/fetch-cheats` route, allowing the UI to pull codes from the Libretro database.
- **Fix**: Cheat Toggling — Fixed a bug where enabling/disabling a cheat code would fail due to an incorrect database method name.
- **Fix**: API Consistency — Updated the scrape response format to match frontend expectations for immediate UI updates.

## 1.1.1 – 2026-05-14

- **Fix**: Corrected automatic art scraping and RetroAchievements settings lookup. Fixed a bug where incorrect field names were used to retrieve service credentials, which prevented automatic art fetching during upload and RA progress tracking.

## 1.1.0 – 2026-05-14

- **Modular Architecture**: Retired the 5,500-line monolithic `server/routes.ts` in favour of 13 specialized route modules under `server/routes/`. This significantly improves maintainability and developer velocity.
- **Enhanced Data Integration**: Refactored the `gamelist.xml` parser (supporting EmulationStation and LaunchBox formats) to extract enriched metadata, including star ratings, play counts, and last-played timestamps.
- **Improved Test Isolation**: Implemented lazy database initialization and per-test data directory logic, achieving 100% passing tests with zero shared-state pollution.
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Updated `Dockerfile` to support both AMD64 and ARM64 (aarch64) base images automatically.
- **Bug Fix**: Restored missing `/api/kiosk` public configuration route.
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved gamepad binding leak between Player 1 and Player 2.

## 0.7.36 – 2026-05-11

- Feature: **ROM scanner** — set `CABINET_ROM_WATCH_DIR` in the HA add-on environment to auto-import ROM files dropped into a folder; polls every 60 seconds; system detected from extension (nes/snes/genesis/n64/gb/gbc/gba/nds/ps1/ps2/psp/dreamcast/arcade); Settings → Library shows watch dir, last scan time, total imported, and a "Scan now" button; run `node server/apply-scanner-patch.mjs` once from `cabinet_bridge/` to activate

## 0.7.33 – 2026-05-11

- Feature: **Play status badge on game cards** — colored dot next to system name: amber = Playing, green = Beaten, purple = Completed; hidden when status is Unset
- Feature: **Live play timer** — fixed pill in the top-right corner of the emulator overlay ticks mm:ss (then h:mm:ss) from the moment the game boots; run `node server/apply-overlay-patches.mjs` once from `cabinet_bridge/` to activate

- Fix: ReferenceError in bootstrap.js diagnostic — `core` used as JS runtime variable instead of TS template interpolation; changed to `${core}` so it resolves server-side

## 0.3.11

- Fix: critical SyntaxError in bootstrap.js line 877 — `rows.join("\n")` inside a TypeScript template literal produced a literal newline character in generated JS, breaking game loading; changed to `rows.join("")`
