# Changelog

## 0.3.15

- Feature: Settings page now uses tabs (General, Library, Services, Controls, Kiosk, HA Setup)
- Feature: Controls tab — per-console keyboard binding editor; click any button to remap, saves globally, applied on next game launch
- Schema: added controlDefaults to integration settings; server reads saved bindings and injects into EJS_defaultControls at launch time

## 0.3.14

- Polish: Settings page cleaned up — removed duplicate RetroAchievements and EmulationStation sections, removed stale prototype language, regrouped service credentials together, cleaner section order

## 0.3.13

- Fix: fast-forward button now calls Module.setFastForward() with fallback chain for different EmulatorJS builds
- Fix: rewind changed from broken toggle to hold-to-rewind (mousedown/touchstart starts rewind, mouseup/touchend stops) — matches how RetroArch rewind actually works

## 0.3.12

- Fix: ReferenceError in bootstrap.js diagnostic — `core` used as JS runtime variable instead of TS template interpolation; changed to `${core}` so it resolves server-side

## 0.3.11

- Fix: critical SyntaxError in bootstrap.js line 877 — `rows.join("\n")` inside a TypeScript template literal produced a literal newline character in generated JS, breaking game loading; changed to `rows.join("")`

## 0.3.10

- Fix: critical SyntaxError in bootstrap.js (introduced by v0.3.9 diagnostic) — JSON.stringify inside a string literal broke game loading entirely
- The diagnostic console.log now uses string concatenation instead of JSON.stringify

## 0.3.9

- Fix: system logo `<img>` src now routed through `apiUrl()` — fixes 404s hitting HA's own API instead of the addon under Ingress
- Fix: system hardware image URLs now routed through `apiUrl()` for the same reason
- Fix: TypeScript error in Dashboard.tsx (`all` object typed as `Record<string,number>`; `uploadedRoms` prop removed from Sidebar call)
- Fix: `system?.monogram` → `system?.mono` in Home.tsx
- Debug: bootstrap.js now logs `[HomeArcade]` markers to browser console and shows `ERR` in the progress overlay if it fails to load — helps diagnose 0% game loading

## 0.3.8

- Fix: service worker now uses a versioned cache name (`home-arcade-v0.3.8`) so stale JS is cleared on every addon update
- Fix: shell HTML is now fetched network-first so the app always boots with the latest code

## 0.3.7

- Removed Quick action endpoints section from Settings
- Removed Wiring guide section from Settings
- Removed PC Status panel section from Settings

## 0.3.6

- System logos now served through `/api/system-logos/:id` proxy — fixes CORS blocks under HA Ingress
- System hardware images return a dark SVG placeholder instead of a 404 when Wikimedia is unreachable
- Removed `crossOrigin` attribute from logo img tags (no longer needed with same-origin proxy)

## 0.3.5

- Controls button now opens a proper panel with the full keyboard layout for the active system (PS1/PS2, GBA, GB/GBC, N64, NDS, PSP, and generic)
- Panel dynamically adapts to the loaded core — shows the right buttons for each console
- Closes on backdrop click, Escape, or ×

## 0.3.4

- **Home Dashboard** — new default landing page with Continue Playing hero, stat cards (total hours, completed, in progress, backlog), system play-time bars, status donut chart, week-over-week activity, game highlights, and In Progress / Recently Played / New This Week shelves
- Sidebar gains a Dashboard nav link
- Library view moved to `/library`

## 0.3.0

- **Community score** — scraped from ScreenScraper (`jeu.note`, /20 scale displayed as /10) and shown in game detail dialog
- **Wheel art** — logo overlay fetched from ScreenScraper wheel-hd/wheel/wheel-carbon media; shown in game detail header
- Game detail dialog polish: genre pills, wheel art logo, community score stat, graceful art fallback
