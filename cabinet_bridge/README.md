# Cabinet Bridge — Home Assistant Add-on

Retro gaming frontend that runs inside Home Assistant. ROM uploads, integration
settings, save-state metadata, and the system-image cache live under `/data` so
they persist across add-on restarts and updates.

Source and full documentation: <https://github.com/GlerschNersch/token>

## Install

1. **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories** and add:

   ```
   https://github.com/GlerschNersch/token
   ```

2. Find **Cabinet Bridge** in the store and click **Install** (the first build
   may take several minutes).
3. Click **Start**. The add-on listens on port 5000 internally and is exposed
   via Home Assistant Ingress (sidebar entry: **Cabinet**, or use **Open Web
   UI** from the add-on page).

Connection settings (HA base URL, long-lived token, endpoint overrides, Live
mode) are managed from inside the panel at **Settings**, and persist to the
add-on's SQLite database.

### Add-on options

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_upload_mb` | `2048` | Per-file ROM upload ceiling. Raise for very large PS2 disc images, lower to fence off the add-on from oversized uploads. |

The add-on also enables `ingress_stream: true` so Home Assistant streams large
upload bodies through the Supervisor proxy instead of capping them at the
default 16 MB ingress limit.

## Updating

Home Assistant only surfaces an **Update** button when the add-on `version`
changes. To check for and apply updates:

1. **Settings → Add-ons → ⋮ → Check for updates**.
2. Open **Cabinet Bridge** and click **Update** if it appears.
3. If you expect an update but don't see one, use **⋮ → Rebuild** to force a
   fresh build, then hard-refresh the panel (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-R) to drop cached
   JS/CSS.

> Maintainers: bump `version:` in `config.yaml` for every shipped change.
> Home Assistant will not detect a new build without a version change.

## Persistent data

| Path | What it stores |
| --- | --- |
| `/data/data.db` | SQLite — integration settings and ROM metadata |
| `/data/rom-storage/` | Uploaded ROM files, organized by system slug |
| `/data/system-image-cache/` | Downloaded console artwork |

If `/data` is not writable (e.g. when running outside Home Assistant) the
backend honors `CABINET_DATA_DIR`, otherwise falls back to the current working
directory.

## ROM uploads

The backend must run as the Home Assistant add-on for uploads to work. Uploads
write to `/data/rom-storage/` and `/data/data.db`, which only exist inside the
Supervisor-managed container. A standalone deploy of the SPA will load the UI
but every upload will 404.

If you see a 404 on upload under HA ingress: confirm the add-on is started,
hard-refresh the panel (the SPA detects the
`/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/` prefix only after the latest JS is loaded), and
update or rebuild the add-on if it is out of date.

The mobile picker uses an unfiltered file dialog; allowed extensions are
validated server-side per system after the file is chosen. Supported archive
formats include `.zip` and `.7z`; PS1 also accepts `.cue`/`.bin`/`.iso`/`.chd`/
`.pbp`.

Per-file uploads are capped at the value of the `max_upload_mb` add-on option
(default 2048 MB / 2 GB). The Settings panel shows the active limit next to
the file picker and refuses oversize files before sending them.

## Local development (without Home Assistant)

The application source lives inside this `cabinet_bridge/` directory so Home
Assistant Supervisor can build the add-on with this folder as the Docker
context. Run npm commands from here:

```bash
cd cabinet_bridge
npm install
CABINET_DATA_DIR=/tmp/cabinet-data npm run dev
```

When `CABINET_DATA_DIR` is unset and `/data` is not writable, the project
falls back to the current working directory.
