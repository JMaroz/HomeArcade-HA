ROMs are organized into system subfolders at the destination.
- **M3U & Disc Group Support** — Playlist content is rewritten to reflect new child paths; disc-group siblings are moved together.

### API

- `POST /api/roms/move-all` — Accepts `{ dest }`, validates against allowed browse roots, moves every ROM, updates DB paths, and returns `{ moved, skipped, failed, errors }`.

---

## [2.47.0] — 2026-06-27

### Feature: Upload Destination Picker

- **Custom Upload Directory** — Added a "Change" button in the upload panel to choose where uploaded ROMs land. Defaults to ROM storage. Scanner watch paths appear as suggested quick-root buttons.

---

## [2.43.27] — 2026-05-25


### Fix: Mobile Game Display Placement & Virtual Controls Overlay

- **Repositioned Mobile Game Canvas** — Added `padding-top: 50px` for screen sizes smaller than `768px` in [player.ts](file:///C:/Users/matt/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/HomeArcade-HA/cabinet_bridge/server/routes/player.ts) to push the game display down on mobile screens, clearing it from the Home Assistant Lovelace / Ingress header bar and preventing top-edge clipping.
- **Robust Virtual Gamepad Hidden Styles** — Configured `window.EJS_VirtualGamepadSettings` with an off-screen dummy button to bypass EmulatorJS's default controls fallback logic.
- **Expanded CSS Hiding Selectors** — Expanded the CSS hiding rules to target all underscore-based (`.ejs_virtualGamepad`, `.ejs_vpad`) and camelCase class/ID selectors used internally by the emulator.

---

## [2.43.26] — 2026-05-25

### Fix: Duplicate Mobile Virtual Gamepads

- **Disabled Default EmulatorJS Touch Controls** — Configured `window.EJS_VirtualGamepadSettings = []` and corrected capitalization of `window.EJS_Buttons` to prevent EmulatorJS from rendering its default virtual controller overlay alongside HomeArcade's custom virtual gamepad.

---

## [2.43.23] — 2026-05-25

### Refactor: Clean Event Delegation for Save Grid

- **Replaced Inline Handlers** — Refactored the Save manager's slot list rendering in `player.ts` to use data attributes instead of inline `onclick` string templates.
- **Event Delegation** — Added a single click handler to the grid container that catches clicks from action buttons and maps them dynamically. This completely removes the multi-layer nesting/escaping difficulty.

---

## [2.43.22] — 2026-05-25

### Fix: Pause Menu Element Null Reference Crashes

- **Wired Missing Save Manager HTML and Styles** — Embedded the missing `cabinet-save-panel` HTML section and CSS styles inside `renderEmulatorPage` so that the Saves panel loads and opens correctly.
- **Implemented Null-Safe Button Bindings** — Secured the event listener setup by introducing a `safeOnClick` helper for setting element `.onclick` handlers. This prevents any `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null` crashes if certain controls (e.g. sync buttons) are not present in the DOM.

---

## [2.43.21] — 2026-05-25

### Fix: Save State Slot ReferenceError

- **Escaped Template Interpolation** — Escaped the client-side `slot.slot` variable template interpolations inside the load and delete save state button handlers. This resolves the server-side crash throwing "Server error: slot is not defined".
